ForzaETH Race Stack by the [D-ITET Center for Project Based Learning (PBL)](https://pbl.ee.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich. 

Accompanying this repository, a paper titled *ForzaETH Race Stack - Scaled Autonomous Head-to-Head Racing on Fully Commercial off-the-Shelf Hardware* is available on [Journal of Field Robotics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/rob.22429), detailing the system's architecture, algorithms, and performance benchmarks.

**NOTE**: For extensions on said paper, tied to specific publications, please refer to the later paragraph [Additional Publications](#additional-publications) 

**NOTE**: We have a **ROS2** version of this stack, check out the other branches of this repo! 

## Installation

We provide an installation guide [here](./INSTALLATION.md).

## Getting started

After installation, the car (or the simulation environment) is ready to be tested. For examples on how to run the different modules on the car, refer to the [`stack_master` README](./stack_master/README.md). As a further example, the [time-trials](./stack_master/checklists/TimeTrials.md) or the [head-to-head](./stack_master/checklists/HeadToHead.md) checklists are a good starting point.
