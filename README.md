ForzaETH Race Stack by the [D-ITET Center for Project Based Learning (PBL)](https://pbl.ee.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich. 

Accompanying this repository, a paper titled *ForzaETH Race Stack - Scaled Autonomous Head-to-Head Racing on Fully Commercial off-the-Shelf Hardware* is available on [Journal of Field Robotics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/rob.22429), detailing the system's architecture, algorithms, and performance benchmarks.

**Note:** The results in the paper have been evaluated in the ROS1 version of the stack. As this is the ROS 2 version of the ForzaETH Race Stack, results may differ, as well as certain functionalities might be **missing** such as (might be added in the future):
- Baysian Optimization
- CPU Usage Measurements
- Car2Car Syncing
- SynPF integration
- Scan Alignment
- System Identification

**Note:** In general the ROS 2 stack is significantly less tested and explored than the ROS 1 version!

## Installation

We provide an installation guide [here](.docker_utils/README.md).

## Getting started

After installation, the car (or the simulation environment) is ready to be tested. For examples on how to run the different modules on the car, refer to the [`stack_master` README](./stack_master/README.md).

### Problems
If you are having problem with the SIM (no car/scans showing for example), try the setup once again:
```bash
source ~/ws/src/race_stack/.install_utils/f110_sim_setup.sh
```

If your joystick is not working, try the following while the controller is connected:
```bash
sudo chmod 666 /dev/input/js0
sudo chmod 666 /dev/input/event*
```
