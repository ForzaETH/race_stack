MIP SDK Change Log
==================

The version number scheme for the MIP SDK is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

* The MAJOR number is incremented when breaking changes are made which are not backwards compatible.
  This includes public API changes and especially behavioral changes. It is likely that existing code
  will not work properly and/or may not compile without changes.
* The MINOR number is incremented when a new feature is added or a current feature is improved.
  Minor revisions may incorporate bug fixes and other patches.
* The PATCH number is incremented when a bug is fixed or a small, non-breaking change is made.
  Patches will not significantly affect the behavior of existing code, except where such behavior
  is unintentional or erroneous.

Major revisions will specify what caused the non-backwards compatible change. These will be specified like so:
CHANGED - A non-backwards compatible change was made to an existing function/class.
RENAMED - A function/class has been renamed.
REMOVED - A function/class has been removed.
