The {{{microstrain_inertial_examples}}} package is published for both [[https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/microstrain_inertial/tree/ros/microstrain_inertial_examples|ROS]]
and [[https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/microstrain_inertial/tree/ros2/microstrain_inertial_examples|ROS 2]] and contains
simple device examples useful for users who want to start using a device in ROS. Each example should work out of the box with little configuration.

It is suggested that users start with these examples, copy the example they used into their own package, and then tweak it for their application.
