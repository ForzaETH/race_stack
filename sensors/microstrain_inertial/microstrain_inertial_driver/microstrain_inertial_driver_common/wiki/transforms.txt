= Transforms =

In order to integrate more easily with other ROS tools, the [[microstrain_inertial_driver|microstrain_inertial_driver]] supports publishing several different transforms.

<<Anchor(frame_ids)>>
== Frame IDs ==

When publishing transforms, we will use a configurable set of frame ids.
The table below lists the frame IDs, their defaults, and what they should represent.
Each of these names can be found in the [[https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/microstrain_inertial_driver_common/blob/main/config/params.yml|params.yml]] and can be modified by the user.

|| {{{odometer_frame_id}}} || {{{odometer_link}}}       || Represents the location of the odometer attached to the device (GQ7 only right now). All measurements from the odometer will be reported in this frame ID                    ||
|| {{{target_frame_id}}}   || {{{base_link}}}           || Should be set to whatever Frame ID you want to publish a transform to. For more information see [[#tf_mode_global|Global]] and [[#tf_mode_relative|Relative]]                ||

== Transform Mode ==

The transforms we publish or do not publish is controlled by the {{{tf_mode}}} parameter. Below are the different options.

=== Off ===

The driver will operate in this mode when {{{tf_mode: 0}}}.

In this mode, the driver will not publish any dynamic transforms.
What this means is that transforms containing global or relative position information will not be published.
However, see [[#independently_controlled_transforms|Independently Controlled Transforms]] for a list of transforms
that may still be published in this mode.

<<Anchor(tf_mode_global)>>
=== Global ===

The driver will operate in this mode when {{{tf_mode: 1}}}

In this mode, the driver will publish the following transforms:

  * '''{{{earth_frame_id -> target_frame_id}}}'''
    * '''Description''':
      * This transform will be the transform of {{{target_frame_id}}} with respect to the ECEF frame.
      * The rate at which this transform is published is controlled by the {{{filter_odometry_earth_data_rate}}} configuration option

This mode has been added for those who want to operate in an entirely global context.
Most standard ROS tools do not play nicely with this, and it is recommended to instead use relative mode
if you wish to use tools such as rviz, nav2, move_base, etc.

<<Anchor(tf_mode_relative)>>
=== Relative ===

The driver will operate in this mode when {{{tf_mode: 2}}}

In this mode, the driver will publish the following transforms:

  * '''{{{earth_frame_id -> map_frame_id}}}'''
    * '''Description''':
      * This transform will be the location of the local tangent plane in ECEF.
      * This transform requires that the user has also configured relative position. See [[microstrain_inertial_driver/relative_position_configuration|Relative Position Configuration]] for more information on how to do that.
  * '''{{{map_frame_id -> target_frame_id}}}'''
    * '''Description''':
      * This transform will be the location of {{{target_frame_id}}} with respect to the local tangent plane.
      * The rate at which this transform is published is controlled by the {{{filter_odometry_map_data_rate}}} configuration option

This mode has been added to allow for easy integration with tools such as rviz, nav2, move_base etc.

<<Anchor(independently_controlled_transforms)>>
=== Independently Controlled Transforms ===

The following frames may be published regardless of {{{tf_mode}}}.
See the list below for more information on the parameters to use to configure them and what they represent.

  * '''{{{frame_id -> gnss1_frame_id}}}'''
    * '''Configured With Parameter''': {{{gnss1_antenna_offset}}}
    * '''Description''':
      * This transform will be published if the device has at least 1 GNSS antenna, and will be the transform from the device to GNSS antenna 1.
      * If the device supports streaming [[https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.microstrain.com/GQ7+User+Manual/external_content/dcp/Data/filter_data/data/mip_field_filter_multi_antenna_offset_correction.htm|Multi Antenna Offset Correction]], setting {{{mip_filter_multi_antenna_offset_correction_data_rate}}} to a non-zero value will cause this transform to be updated at that rate with corrections from the device
  * '''{{{frame_id -> gnss2_frame_id}}}'''
    * '''Configured With Parameter''': {{{gnss2_antenna_offset}}}
    * '''Description''':
      * This transform will be published if the device has at least 2 GNSS antennas, and will be the transform from the device to GNSS antenna 2.
      * If the device supports streaming [[https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.microstrain.com/GQ7+User+Manual/external_content/dcp/Data/filter_data/data/mip_field_filter_multi_antenna_offset_correction.htm|Multi Antenna Offset Correction]], setting {{{mip_filter_multi_antenna_offset_correction_data_rate}}} to a non-zero value will cause this transform to be updated at that rate with corrections from the device
  * '''{{{frame_id -> odometer_frame_id}}}'''
    * '''Configured With Parameter''': {{{filter_speed_lever_arm_offset}}}
    * '''Description''':
      * This transform will be published if the device supports an external odometer, and will be the transform from the device to the odometer
  * '''{{{mount_frame_id -> frame_id}}}'''
    * '''Configured With Parameter''': {{{mount_to_frame_id_transform}}}
    * '''Description''':
      * This transform will be published if {{{publish_mount_to_frame_id_transform}}} is true and represents the transform between the sensor and wherever it is mounted.
      * In many cases this should be disabled as this transform will be published by something else, but it has been added as a convenience feature when first integrating.
