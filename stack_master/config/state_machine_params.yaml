# Parameters for local planner
rate: 80  # [hz]
test_on_car: True  # also set True if using on a bag
n_loc_wpnts: 80  # number of local waypoints published, 1 waypoints every 0.1 meter

### FTG Parameters ###
debug: False  # publishes filtered scans if True but may not run smoothly

safety_radius: 40  # helps not to cut corners
max_lidar_dist: 9.

range_offset: 180  # LiDAR has 1080 range points, only consider [range_offset,-range_offset]
track_width: 2.6  # approx gap distance on a straight when there are no obstacles (set debug to True to see gap distances during driving)
max_speed: 6.0
######################

splini_ttl: 2 # [s] ttl counter for validity of spliner waypoints -> NOW DYNAMIC RECONFIGURABLE

gb_ego_width_m: 0.4 # [m], distance from gb path for rejoining 
lateral_width_gb_m: 1.1 # [m] lateral width within which we consider obstacles to be on the overtaking line -> NOW DYNAMIC RECONFIGURABLE
gb_horizon_m: 6.9 # [m] horizon considered for the global waypoints to check for obstacles

overtaking_horizon_m: 6.9 # [m] horizon considered for overtaking
lateral_width_ot_m: 0.3 # [m] lateral width within which we consider opponents to be on the overtaking line -> NOW DYNAMIC RECONFIGURABLE
splini_hyst_timer_sec: 0.2 # [s] time we have to wait between switching from overtaking on one side to the other -> NOW DYNAMIC RECONFIGURABLE

ftg_speed_mps: 0.1 # [m/s] speed threshold below which we start a timer for activating FTG
ftg_timer_sec: 3 # [s] time we have to stay slower than the `ftg_speed` threshold before we activate FTG

volt_threshold: 11 # [V] voltage threshold below which we start screaming
