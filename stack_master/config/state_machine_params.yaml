# Parameters for local planner
rate: 80  # [hz]
test_on_car: True  # also set True if using on a bag
n_loc_wpnts: 80  # number of local waypoints published, 1 waypoints every 0.1 meter

### FTG Parameters ###
debug: False  # publishes filtered scans if True but may not run smoothly

safety_radius: 40  # helps not to cut corners
max_lidar_dist: 9.

range_offset: 180  # LiDAR has 1080 range points, only consider [range_offset,-range_offset]
track_width: 2.6  # approx gap distance on a straight when there are no obstacles (set debug to True to see gap distances during driving)
max_speed: 6.0
