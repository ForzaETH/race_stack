## Experiment 1 ##

# Commanded VESC speed in electrical RPM. Electrical RPM is the mechanical RPM
# multiplied by the number of motor poles. Any value is accepted by this
# driver. However, note that the VESC may impose a more restrictive bounds on the
# range depending on its configuration.
const_erpm: 3000

# Commanded VESC servo output position. Valid range is 0 to 1., check out vesc driver and vesc.yaml: servo_min: 0.1, servo_max: 0.85
const_servo: 0.415

## Experiment 2, send direct current commands and look at acceleration ##
#from vesc.yaml: current_min: 0.0, current_max: 100.0
const_curr: 40
const_brake: 50

accel_time: 1.5 # never exceed 2s
decel_time: 1.5 # never exceed 2s

# Experiment 3 const accel decel with acceleration commands via drive message
const_accel: 5
const_decel: -5

# experiment 4, increase angle from start_pos, to end_pos over angle_time
# drives with const_erpm defined above
angle_time: 20

start_pos: -0.1
end_pos: 0.4

# experiment 5, increase steering angle, drive with const_speed
const_speed: 3

start_angle: 0.1 # rad
end_angle: 0.4    # rad

# experiment 6, follow given acceleration profile and record IMU data 
# profile 1: Step velocity input 2s v=0, 4s v=3, then v=0
# profile 2: Full acceleration for 2s then full brake for 2s.
  #accel_time and decel_time are used as well (profile 2)
acc_profile: 3

# experiment 7, constant speed (const_speed from 5), bang bang steer
period: 3 # [s]
repetitions: 5 # total experiment duration will be <repetitions>*<period> seconds
bangbang_steer: 0.1 # [rad]
